    <p id="about">This app is made by 4 developers, 2A2S – Abhinav, Akshat, Siddhartha, and Sreyank. This app helps in formatting regular tasks. Many apps are designed for more features, but we prefer simplicity, so we make it  in the web. Other apps like this require sign in but this is different, you can save the site data and come back to it later. The main feature of this app is it’s anonymous capability. 
People are making physical objects, digital simulations, apps, but we are addressing the most important problem. Many people in the world are forgetting the importance of time management, so a To-Do list, especially required for students as well as elders. It will be a better idea if it’s a lexicon-student based idea so their will be no worries of privacy as mentioned above.
These features are the turning points of why you should invest in this idea, another plus point is that this can be added to the ERP site of the Lexicon School which will be helpful. This can also be added in the Lexicon Schools App if suitable.
This is our first project in collaboration of Sreyank, Siddhartha, Abhinav and Akshat.
ALL THESE FEATURES MAKE THIS PROJECT DIFFERENT. </p>
