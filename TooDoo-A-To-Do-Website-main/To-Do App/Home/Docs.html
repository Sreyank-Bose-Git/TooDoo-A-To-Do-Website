        Hello This The 2A2S Team And We Would Like To Solve
        Some Of Your Questions And Answers.

            What is Different In This App As Compared To Others?
        </div>
        <div id="qnabar2">
            This app tries to address what many others don't. We have
            painting available here too. This is a lexicon group made
            project which makes this more safe. We respect the privacy
            of users and so (for now) won't take any login data. These
            are some of the key points which we believe makes this
            different from others.

            Why is this project made in the first place?
        </div>
        <div id="qnabar2">
            This app was made for an entrepreneurship competition
            where people had to collaborate and make something truly
            amazing, and here we are. Making something with our own
            to present to the public.

        Technical topics about this application:
        <div id="qnabar">
            Why are there two select options?
        </div>
        <div id="qnabar2">
            There are obviously two select options when first 
            glanced on the designing page. The first one is
            for selecting what kind of element the user wants
            to add on the screen. The second one helps the user
            select the existing element and do something with
            it.
